# Triforce Bank
This is a mod for ModLoader64 for use with OoT Online when playing Triforce Hunt in randomizer. It caches your triforce pieces and restores them if OoTO clients disagree and attempt to set it lower (or "swallow" a triforce piece).

Please note this doesn't do anything with online specifically, it just sets the value in memory. You may need to go to another area or get another item before your higher triforce count syncs back over the server.

Also, the final triforce still will not sync with this. Every individual player will have to get "the last piece" in order to see the end screen.

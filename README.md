# Triforce Bank
This is a mod for ModLoader64 for use with OoT Online when playing Triforce Hunt in randomizer. It caches your triforce pieces and restores them if OoTO clients disagree and attempt to set it lower (or "swallow" a triforce piece).

All players should enable this mod for it to sync properly.
